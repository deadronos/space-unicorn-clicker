# TASK003 - Add Enhanced Visual Effects

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-26  
**Updated:** 2025-10-26
**Completed:** 2025-10-26

## Original Request

Make the game more animated and visually varied with particle effects, damage numbers, enemy variations, and enhanced feedback.

## Thought Process

Based on DESIGN003, focus on:
1. Multiple ship visual variations based on level/type
2. Damage numbers that float up on hit
3. Enhanced explosion effects when ships die
4. Combo counter for rapid clicking
5. Additional background layers (nebula, planets)
6. More particle effects for impacts and collections

Keep performance in mind - limit concurrent particles and use CSS transforms.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create damage number system with floating animation
2. Add explosion particle effect for destroyed ships
3. Implement multiple ship visual variants (armored, speed, boss)
4. Add combo counter for rapid clicks
5. Enhance background with nebula layers
6. Add stardust collection particle effect
7. Improve laser beam effects with intensity scaling
