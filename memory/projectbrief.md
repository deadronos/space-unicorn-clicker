# Project Brief

Space Unicorn Clicker is a minimal idle/clicker game built with React, TypeScript and Vite. The core loop is simple: click the unicorn to deal damage to enemy battleships, earn Stardust currency, buy upgrades that increase click power and DPS, and progress through levels with periodic bosses.

Primary goals

- Provide a small, extendable game demo showcasing animation, local persistence, and incremental progression.
- Keep the codebase minimal and easy to reason about so new contributors can iterate quickly.
- Use modern frontend tooling (Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) and follow simple spec-driven development practices.

Success criteria

- Clicking and auto-DPS award stardust and progress to new ships.
- Upgrades are purchasable and correctly modify derived stats.
- Game state persists across reloads and reasonably handles offline progress.
- Repo contains a Memory Bank describing requirements, designs, and tasks for future contributors.
