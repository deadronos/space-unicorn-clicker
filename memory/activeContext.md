# Active Context

Current focus: establish Memory Bank structure and add initial memory artifacts (project brief, product context, sample design and task) so agents and contributors can follow the spec-driven workflow.

Recent changes

- Added `AGENTS.md` describing agent responsibilities and Memory Bank usage.
- Added `memory/projectbrief.md` and `memory/productContext.md`.

Next steps

- Add `memory/designs/_index.md` and at least one `DESIGN001` example file.
- Add `memory/tasks/_index.md` and at least one `TASK001` example implementing a small change.

Notes

- Use EARS-style requirements in `memory/requirements.md` when possible.
- Keep `memory/progress.md` updated with any changes to onboard future agents.
