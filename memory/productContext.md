# Product Context

Space Unicorn Clicker exists as a small, playful demo and learning project. It is intended to:

- Demonstrate a compact React+TS game loop with minimal dependencies.
- Serve as a playground for experimenting with UI animation, incremental game balance, and lightweight persistence.
- Provide a clear starting point for contributors to add content (upgrades, cosmetics, progression systems).

Target audience

- Frontend developers learning interactive UI and game loops.
- Hobbyists interested in idle/clicker mechanics and balancing.

Non-goals

- Not a full commercial game; it intentionally keeps scope small.
- No server backend required â€” game runs entirely in the browser with local storage.
